# Fitzhugh-Nagumo-model
An attempt at plotting the Fitzhugh-Nagumo model of neuron.
Fitzhugh-Nagumo model is a simpliﬁcation of the more realistic Hodgkin-Huxley model.
Described by two variables,a fast-moving (membrane potential) v and a slow (gating) variable w, as described below:
dv/dt= v(α−v)(v−1)−w + I
dw/dt=  epsilon*(v−γw).
I=applied current
α,γ,epsilon are all some positive constants.
Please notice that the equation I used is a little modified version of the original Fitzhugh-Nagumo model equations.
